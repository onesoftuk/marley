Dear {{name}},

I’m writing because we’re helping homeowners in your area who may be thinking about selling.

At Marley Moves, we buy property directly. That means no estate-agent listing, no public viewings, and a sale timeline that can be shaped around your plans.

If your property is suitable, we can make a straightforward cash offer after a brief review. You are under no obligation, and you can take independent advice before making any decision.

People contact us for different reasons: relocating, probate, downsizing, separating, or simply wanting a more certain sale process.

If you’d like to explore your options, call us on {{phone}} or visit {{url}} and quote {{ref_code}}. We’ll give you a clear response and next steps.

Kind regards,

Marley Moves

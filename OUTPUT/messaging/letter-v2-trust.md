Dear {{name}},

Selling a home can feel like a big step, especially when timing and certainty matter.

At Marley Moves, we keep things simple and respectful. We buy homes directly and explain every stage in plain English, so you can decide what is right for you.

If your property is a fit, we may be able to make a direct cash offer. There is no pressure to proceed, and you’re welcome to seek legal or financial advice before agreeing to anything.

Why people choose to speak with us:
- private, off-market process
- flexible completion dates where possible
- clear communication from start to finish

Even if you are only weighing up options, we’re happy to have a short, no-obligation conversation.

Yours sincerely,

Marley Moves

# Compliance Language Notes (Plain English)

## Purpose
Keep outreach clear, fair, and professional. Avoid pressure, exaggeration, or legal/financial promises.

## Do
- Use accurate, conditional wording: “may”, “if suitable”, “can discuss”.
- Say “no obligation” only if true in practice.
- Encourage independent advice before commitment.
- Be clear about process (review, offer, decision, legal steps).
- Keep tone respectful and factual.
- Include contact details and reference code clearly.

## Don’t
- Don’t guarantee outcomes (“guaranteed sale”, “best price”, “fastest completion”).
- Don’t claim certainty on timing unless contractually controlled.
- Don’t use pressure language (“act now”, “final notice”, “urgent response required”).
- Don’t imply official/government links.
- Don’t criticise estate agents or make comparative claims you cannot prove.
- Don’t hide key terms, conditions, or fees.

## Preferred phrasing examples
- “If your property is suitable, we may be able to make a direct cash offer.”
- “You are under no obligation to proceed.”
- “Completion dates can be discussed based on your circumstances.”

## Avoid phrasing examples
- “We will buy any house in any condition.”
- “Cash in 7 days guaranteed.”
- “This is your last chance.”

## Tone checklist before send
- Is every claim provable?
- Is wording balanced and non-pressuring?
- Would a reasonable reader find this clear and fair?

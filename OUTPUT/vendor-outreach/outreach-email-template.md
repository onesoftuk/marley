Hello [Vendor Contact Name/Team],

My name is Peter Farrell, and I'm reaching out on behalf of **Marley Moves**, a property lead-generation service focused on recently-sold properties in the Dorset area (SP8 postcode and surrounding regions).

We are currently evaluating data partners who can provide **property-level SSTC (Sold Subject to Contract) data** to support our direct-mail outreach campaigns to homeowners.

   - Annual subscription cost
   - Setup fees (if any)
   - Minimum contract term

2. **Data Coverage:**
   - SSTC property-level availability (address, sale price, SSTC date)
   - Geographic coverage (UK-wide? Regional?)
   - Data refresh frequency (daily, weekly?)
   - Historical depth (how far back can we query?)

3. **API & Technical Details:**
   - Delivery method (REST API, webhook, file export?)
   - Authentication mechanism
   - Rate limits and throughput
   - SLA commitments (uptime, latency)
   - Sample API response/payload

4. **Licensing & Compliance:**
   - Explicit permission for **direct-mail marketing use cases**
   - Data retention limits
   - Usage restrictions
   - GDPR/data protection compliance assurances

5. **Support & Reliability:**

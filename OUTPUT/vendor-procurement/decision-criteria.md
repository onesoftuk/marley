# Marley Moves SSTC Feed Vendor Decision Criteria

## Weighted scoring model (100 points total)
- Cost: 25%
- Licensing (incl. direct mail permissions): 25%
- Latency (p50/p95 + refresh timeliness): 20%
- Coverage (geographic + property-level SSTC availability): 20%
- Reliability (SLA/support/incident handling): 10%

## Scoring scale (use 1-5 per category)
- 5 = Excellent / low risk / fully meets requirement
- 4 = Good / minor gaps
- 3 = Acceptable / manageable gaps
- 2 = Weak / material gaps
- 1 = Unacceptable / high risk

## Calculation
For each vendor:
- Weighted Score = ((Cost×25) + (Licensing×25) + (Latency×20) + (Coverage×20) + (Reliability×10)) / 5
- Result is a score out of 100.

## Minimum gates (must-pass)
1. Licensing for direct mail: PASS/FAIL
2. Property-level SSTC data availability: PASS/FAIL
3. Commercial fit within budget envelope: PASS/FAIL

If any must-pass gate = FAIL, vendor is not shortlisted regardless of weighted score.

## Practical evaluation checklist
- Cost: pilot + annual + setup + minimum term clear and acceptable
- Licensing: direct mail rights explicit in writing; retention limits acceptable
- Latency: p50/p95 and refresh cadence evidenced by vendor
- Coverage: target geographies and property-level completeness confirmed
- Reliability: SLA, support hours, escalation path, and uptime history provided

## Suggested decision rule
- Shortlist threshold: Weighted Score >= 70 and all must-pass gates = PASS
- Preferred vendor: highest weighted score among shortlisted vendors

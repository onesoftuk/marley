## Recording notes (speed + conversion)
- Keep delivery conversational, around 130–150 words/min.
- Pause 0.5s after key promises ("clear pricing", "on time", "no-obligation quote").
- Keep CTA on screen for final 3–4 seconds.
- Use clear, readable text overlays only (no platform-specific stickers/effects).

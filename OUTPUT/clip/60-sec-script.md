# 60-Second Educational Explainer Script

Moving doesn’t fail because people don’t plan. It fails because they get bad information early.

Here’s what to lock in first:

**One: timing.**  
Book your removals team as soon as your date is likely, not once everything is final. Good slots go quickly.

**Two: volume.**  
Most quote mistakes happen because item lists are incomplete. Share clear room-by-room details, including stairs, access, and large furniture.

**Three: total cost.**  
Don’t just compare headline price. Ask what’s included: packing, disassembly, waiting time, mileage, and insurance.

That’s exactly how Marley Moves works. We give clear quotes, practical move planning, and a dependable team on the day.

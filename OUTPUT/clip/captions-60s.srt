Moving doesn’t fail because people don’t plan.
It fails because they get bad information early.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,800
Here’s what to lock in first:

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,000
One: timing.
Book your removals team as soon as your date is likely.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,800
Don’t wait until everything is final.
Good slots go quickly.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,000
Two: volume.
Most quote mistakes happen when item lists are incomplete.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Share room-by-room details,
including stairs, access, and large furniture.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,200
Three: total cost.
Don’t just compare headline price.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,000
Ask what’s included:
packing, disassembly, waiting time, mileage, insurance.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,500
That’s how Marley Moves works:
